/**
 * **One normalised parity row, and thin adapters into it.**
 *
 * The whole point of this file is that there is exactly one row shape and
 * exactly one key derivation in the repository, so that the published artifact,
 * the working schedule and an externally-sourced re-import can all be compared
 * by {@link import('./parity.js').compareParityRows} rather than by three
 * hand-rolled loops that agree until they do not.
 *
 * ## The field vocabulary is the corpus's own
 *
 * `date`, `startMinutes`, `venue`, `field`, `format`, `division`, `home`,
 * `away` — the eight columns `combined_schedule.csv` and
 * `published_rec_schedule.csv` are written in, and the same eight
 * `fixtures/season2026Parsers.js` `publicationKey()` has always joined. That is
 * not a coincidence: `publicationKey()` now delegates to
 * {@link parityRowKey} rather than keeping a second spelling of the same idea.
 * A ninth, `participant`, exists for per-team artifacts and is `null` on every
 * row those two files produce — see {@link PARITY_FIELD_ORDER}.
 *
 * Times are **minutes past local midnight** and dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`. No
 * `Date` is constructed in this package (GAP-30): the corpus is wall clock, two
 * of its dates fall after DST ends, and a comparison that normalised through an
 * absolute instant would move a published 8:30 AM by an hour on one machine and
 * not another — the parity checker causing the divergence it exists to detect.
 *
 * ## `null` means "this source does not carry that column"
 *
 * It never means "empty" and never means "equal". `external_fixtures_published.csv`
 * has no `Division` and no `Format` column at all; the adapter leaves both
 * `null` and the subject that uses those rows names the fields it can honestly
 * compare. A compared field that is `null` on either side of a pair is
 * `PARITY_FIELD_ABSENT` at blocking rather than a silent match.
 *
 * The corollary is {@link exportCell}, and it is the whole reason that function
 * exists rather than `row[header] || null`: **a cell the artifact carries and
 * left blank is a value, not a missing column.** `generateScheduleExports()`
 * writes `fieldId ?? ''` and `division ?? ''`, so a published fixture whose
 * field was later cleared arrives here as an empty `Field` cell. Folding that
 * into `null` made it read as a column the export vocabulary does not have,
 * which put the pair in `buckets.matched`, counted it in `PARITY_ROWS_MATCHED`
 * and told the family whose pitch had gone precisely nothing. Absent and empty
 * are different, exactly as unknown and zero are.
