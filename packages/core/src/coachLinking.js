/**
 * Link imported coaches to their player-children so the team generator anchors
 * a team around each coaching family.
 *
 * The generator (`teamGeneration.js`) creates one team per unique
 * `player.coachId` within a division and keeps the coach's child on that team.
 * Historically `coachId` was only derived from a `willing_to_coach` flag on the
 * player row; this module instead projects the durable `coaches` table (and its
 * resolved child links) onto the player set, so a separately-imported coach
 * roster actually drives teaming.
 *
 * Pure module — no React / Supabase imports.
