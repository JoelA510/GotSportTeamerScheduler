/**
 * The four questions, one call each.
 *
 * > *Real questions from the source project that each required manual
 * > derivation and should be one call:*
 * >
 * > - *"Why is this game at 12:00 and not 10:30?"*
 * > - *"What's the earliest kickoff allowing a full 30-minute warm-up?"*
 * > - *"Why did this team get a conflict?"*
 * > - *"Why can't this game go later?"*
 *
 * Each of the four is a thin call over machinery that already answers it, and
 * the point of the file is which machinery:
 *
 * | question | answered by | this file adds |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | why at this time | `resolve/legality.js` `checkPlacement()` at the slot it has **and** at the one it does not | the counterfactual, as a pair |
 * | earliest kickoff with a full warm-up | `timing/warmup.js` `earliestKickoffWithWarmup()` (Prompt 1.2, incident 8) | the bounding booking as a claim |
 * | why this conflict | `waivers/coachTravel.js` `evaluateCoachTravel()` + `people/roster.js` `soleCoachRiskRegister()` | the join: which team, whose game, and whether anybody could have covered |
 * | why not later | `availability/kickoff.js` `latestLegalKickoff()` | the ordered claims, and the headroom against the kickoff it has |
 *
 * Nothing here re-derives a bound, a violation or a tightness ordering.
 * `orderByTightness()` already answers *"sunset by 6 minutes, then the permit by
 * 66"*, and the ordering it produced is passed through
 * {@link import('./claims.js').mergeClaimsByTightness} untouched.
 *
 * ## `status` is about the answer, not about the game
 *
 * A game that is illegal where it stands gets a perfectly good attribution
 * saying so, whose `status` is `allowed`. The game's own verdict is
 * `placementStatus` / `legal`, straight from `checkPlacement()`. See
 * `attribution/reasonCodes.js`.
 *
 * ## One fact can arrive twice, and both copies are kept
 *
 * A `LINING_MISMATCH` on a corpus `Scrimmage` row reaches an attribution by two
 * independent routes: the placement check for that slot, and the standing rule
 * that claims the same code about the same game. Both are reported, with
 * different `source` values and different instance ids, and neither is
 * suppressed. Two paths agreeing is information — it is the difference between a
 * finding and a finding nothing else can see — and a de-duplication here would
 * be this module deciding which of two other modules to believe.

 * committed to, *which* game of theirs, how many minutes apart the two kick off,
 * and — from `soleCoachRiskRegister()` and `coCoachesOf()` — whether that team
 * had anybody else who could have covered, by name.
 *
 * The team universe is read from the schedule's own `teamUniverse`, never
 * enumerated from the commitments: a team whose commitments a broken join
 * dropped would otherwise come back "no conflict" instead of "unknown".
