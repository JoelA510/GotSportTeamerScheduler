/**
 * Machine-readable reason codes for every waiver decision, the disposition
 * vocabulary that keeps "waived" distinguishable from "clean", and the frozen
 * severity table that turns a list of findings into a status.
 *
 * Same two rules as `facility/reasonCodes.js`, `timing/reasonCodes.js`,
 * `availability/reasonCodes.js` and `constraints/reasonCodes.js`:
 *
 * 1. **`code` is the contract, `message` is decoration.** Never parse a message.
 * 2. **Severity lives in a table, never at a call site.**
 *
 * Severities and statuses are *imported* from the facility module rather than
 * redeclared, exactly as the other three modules import them, so a waiver
 * finding lands in the same list as a facility one and
 * {@link deriveWaiverStatus} reads nothing but `finding.severity`.
 *
 * ## Why these codes are **not** merged into `BASE_REASON_SEVERITY`
 *
 * `constraints/baseSeverity.js` merges the tables of every module whose codes a
 * *constraint record may claim*. A waiver code describes the waiver machinery
 * itself — "this exception was applied", "this exception no longer does
 * anything" — and no constraint governs it. Registering these codes there would
 * let a record claim `WAIVER_APPLIED` and pretend to set its hardness, which is
 * meaningless. The seam stays one-directional: waivers read the constraint
 * registry, the registry knows nothing about waivers.

 * **"Waived, not clean" is this enum, not a boolean.**
 *
 * The Phase 1 status (`allowed` / `compromised` / `rejected`) answers *how bad

 * precisely the difference incident 9 is about: a game that is `compromised`
 * because a 7v7 is playing on a 9v9-lined pitch and a game that is
 * `compromised` because the board signed a piece of paper are two different
 * facts, and collapsing them is how a waiver stops being visible.
 *
 * So a waiver-aware evaluation reports **two** values, and both are derived
 * mechanically:
 *
 * - `status` — the Phase 1 three-state, from the severities as always;
 * - `disposition` — this enum, from the 2x2 of *did any waiver fire* and *does

 * | **no waiver fired** | `clean` | `unwaived` |

 * guarantees, and the reason it exists: a subject with a waived violation can
 * never report `clean`, and can never report `allowed` either, because
