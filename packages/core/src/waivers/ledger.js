/**
 * The waiver ledger: build it, query it, and reconcile it against the
 * constraint registry it excepts.
 *
 * `docs/MODEL_GAPS.md` GAP-26 is the "before" this module is the "after" of:
 *
 * > **Today**: no waiver, exception or override record of any kind. There is
 * > nowhere to store the subject (person / team / venue pair), the constraint
 * > being waived, the rationale, who approved it, or its validity window — and
 * > therefore no way to detect that a waiver has gone dormant.
 *
 * A ledger is **immutable**, like a registry. `withoutWaiver()` returns a new
 * ledger rather than mutating, which is what lets dormancy be answered by
 * building the alternative and comparing — the same shape
 * `whatIfConstraintType()` uses in Prompt 2.1, deliberately, because "what
 * would this schedule look like without X?" is one question and should not
 * grow two implementations.
 *
 * Phase 2 is **in-memory only**. There is no SQL home for waiver records and
 * this work deliberately does not create one: the schema belongs to the phase
 * that has real persistence requirements, not to the phase still settling the
 * model.

 *   rebuild leaves the record on disk governing nothing at all, which is
 *   exactly how the original waiver was lost;
 * - the constraint says **`waivable: false`** (`blocking`). Sunset margins and
 *   permit windows are not anybody's to sign away;
 * - the waiver names **reason codes the constraint does not govern**
 *   (`compromise`). It would cover nothing while looking specific.
 *
 * This runs on demand rather than inside `buildWaiverLedger()` because a ledger
 * is meaningful without a registry — it is a list of decisions somebody made —
 * while this check is only meaningful with one. `applyWaivers()` repeats the
 * two `blocking` checks per subject, because a waiver that must not apply must
 * not apply even when nobody ran the audit.
