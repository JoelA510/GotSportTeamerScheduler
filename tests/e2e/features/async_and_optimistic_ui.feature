Feature: Async States and Optimistic UI Updates
  As a League Administrator
  I want clear indicators for background processes and immediate UI feedback
  So that I have a responsive and predictable experience

  Background:
    Given I am logged into SquadLogic as an "admin"

  Scenario: Teaming Configuration Rules
    Given I am on the "Team Management" page
    When I change the "Max Roster" input to "10"
    And I enter a "Random Seed" of "12345"
    And I click "Generate Teams"
    Then the resulting teams summary should reflect the new constraints

  Scenario: Persistence Sync Timeout Handling
    Given I am on the "Team Management" page
    And I have generated a new set of teams
    When the network connection stalls
    And I click "Sync to Supabase" on the Team Persistence Panel
    Then the panel status should change to "Supabase sync timed out. Please retry."

  Scenario: Medical Clearance Optimistic Toggle
    Given I am on the "Compliance Dashboard"
    And I am viewing a registration for "Alex" with a "Reviewing" medical status
    When I click the "Reviewing" medical clearance button
    Then the button should instantly change to a blue "Cleared" state
    And the database should be updated in the background without a page refresh

  Scenario: Output Generation Async Pipeline
    Given I am on the "Outcome" workflow step on Dashboard
    When I click "Generate CSVs"
    Then the button should disable and show "Generating..."
    When the generation completes, I click "Upload to Storage"
    Then the status text should pulse orange saying "Uploading to Storage..."
    And eventually display a green success message confirming completion

  Scenario: Recharts Tooltip Rendering
    Given I am on the "Reporting Dashboard"
    When I hover my mouse over the "Compliance Status" chart
    Then a dark-themed tooltip should appear showing exact counts
