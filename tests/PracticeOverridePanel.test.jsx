/**
 * The manual-override conflict check, on the shape the app actually hands it.
 *
 * **The defect this file exists to hold shut.** `PracticeOverridePanel` opened
 * its check with `if (!team || !team.headCoach) return null`. Nothing in this
 * repo produces `headCoach` outside `mockSupabaseClient.js`'s seed rows — no
 * query selects it, no mapper writes it, no migration declares it — and the
 * panel's own team source, `PracticeSchedulingPage.normalizeTeam()`, emits
 * `coachId` and `assistantCoachIds` and never that field. So on real data the
 * guard short-circuited every time and the panel reported "no conflict" for
 * every override it was ever asked about: a live check matching zero records,
 * the same class as issue #364.
 *
 * The tests below drive the **rendered panel** with teams built by
 * `normalizeTeam()` itself, so the evidence is about the shipped path rather
 * than about a fixture written to agree with the new code. The first test
 * proves the old guard would have short-circuited on exactly this input; the
 * second proves the panel now reports the conflict; the third is the control
 * that makes the second mean something.
