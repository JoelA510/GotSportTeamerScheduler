/**
 * Fairness and equity metrics — Prompt 7.2.
 *
 * > *Is anybody being treated unlike their peers — and is that a real inequity,
 * > or a property of how the fixture list is written?*
 *
 * Five properties are what this file is for, and each has a positive control
 * that is **constructed** rather than asserted:
 *
 * 1. **The league / external / friendly distinction is load bearing, and the
 *    number of false positives it removes is measured, not claimed.** The same
 *    metric is run with the distinction and without it, on the same corpus, and
 *    the difference is asserted as a figure.
 * 2. **Every flag publishes its comparison basis and its arithmetic.** Swept
 *    over every flag of every shape, with a meta-assertion that the sweep saw
 *    one.
 * 3. **Three-valued, never two.** `typical` and `undecided` are shown to be
 *    different answers, and the collapse is attempted deliberately to show it
 *    fails.
 * 4. **Every meta-assertion can fail**, and the input that makes each fail is
 *    built here and run through the public entry point.
 * 5. **An unmeasurable subject contributes nothing to an objective, and is
 *    counted.** Shown by constructing the schedule that would score better under
 *    the fold-into-zero version.
 *
 * Every figure below is derived from the corpus at test time. Nothing is
 * hand-copied except the counts the corpus README itself declares.
 *
 * **Test-hygiene note.** No corpus lookup is dereferenced in a `describe` body:
 * a `TypeError` at file load fails the whole file instead of firing the
 * meta-assertion that was supposed to catch it. Every subject is built inside a
 * test through {@link corpusReport} / {@link corpusFixtures}, which memoise.
