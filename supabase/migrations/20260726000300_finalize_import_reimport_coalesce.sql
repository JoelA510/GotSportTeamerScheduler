-- Fix re-import data loss: finalize_import_job and finalize_coach_import_job
-- silently wiped admin-entered data on a narrower re-import.
--
-- finalize_import_job's existing-player UPDATE (originally
-- 20260611000200_import_gotsport_expanded_mapping.sql:409-448) already
-- COALESCEd years_played/paid against the existing row, but overwrote
-- preferred_name/grade/gender/birth_year/skill_tier/willing_to_coach/
-- coach_volunteer/buddy_request/medical_info/contact_info/guardian_contacts/
-- custom_attributes unconditionally. guardian_contacts resolves to
-- '[]'::jsonb and willing_to_coach resolves to plain false whenever the
-- re-imported CSV lacks those columns (a narrower/corrected GotSport export
-- is an explicitly supported re-import scenario per
-- docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md #8), so re-running an import with fewer columns
-- silently erased admin-entered guardian contacts and coaching-interest
-- flags for every matched player -- with no error or warning.
-- finalize_coach_import_job (20260503060000_coach_import_apply_rollback.sql)
-- had the same split: can_coach_multiple_teams was correctly tri-stated,
-- but certifications/contact_info/custom_attributes were not.
--
-- admin_update_player (20260611000100_player_admin_mutation_rpcs.sql:141-148)
-- already implements the correct field-presence-conditional pattern for the
-- same fields -- this migration carries that pattern into both import-
-- finalize paths. first_name/last_name/date_of_birth are left unconditional:
-- they are guaranteed non-null for any row that reaches these UPDATEs (both
-- functions require them upstream to consider a row valid/matchable), so a
-- re-import correcting a typo'd name or DOB is expected sync behavior, not
-- data loss -- COALESCE there would be a no-op, not a protection.
--
-- willing_to_coach/coach_volunteer need a true three-state distinction
-- (yes / no / column-not-in-this-export), not just NULL-vs-value, because
-- "coaching_answer" was previously collapsed to '' for both "explicitly no"
-- and "column absent". The pending CTE now keeps coaching_answer nullable
-- (NULL only when the column is genuinely absent from this row's payload);
-- valid_candidates derives willing_to_coach as NULL in that case instead of
-- false, and the existing-row UPDATE COALESCEs against the prior value. New
-- players (no existing row to preserve) default a NULL willing_to_coach to
-- false, matching the existing `paid` pattern (COALESCE(paid, false)).
--
-- contact_info/custom_attributes are merged (existing || new) rather than
-- COALESCEd, since jsonb_strip_nulls already drops absent keys from the new
-- object -- a `||` merge naturally keeps an existing email/phone/custom
-- field the new payload doesn't carry while still applying whatever the new
-- payload does carry. guardian_contacts and certifications are jsonb
-- arrays, where an empty array is the "absent" sentinel (mirrors the
-- payment_status_text = '' -> NULL pattern already used for `paid` in the
-- same function), so they use COALESCE(NULLIF(new, '[]'::jsonb), existing).
--
-- Wholesale function replacement per docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md #11
-- ("migrations replace functions wholesale... copy the latest full revision
-- and edit that").
--
-- Reversible: see docs/sql/20260726000300_revert.sql.
-- Smoke checks: see docs/sql/20260726000300_smoke.sql.
